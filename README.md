# Project Title: Olympic Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Olympic data spanning the years 1986 to 2016. The goal is to provide insights into various aspects of Olympic history, including medal tallies, overall trends, country-specific performances, and athlete-centric analyses. The project also involves creating a Streamlit web application that allows users to interactively explore the statistical analyses and visualizations generated from the dataset.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains extensive information about Olympic athletes and results. The dataset can be accessed here: [120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis phase of this project involves various analyses and visualizations to uncover valuable insights from the Olympic dataset. The analyses include:

1. **Medal Tally Analysis:** Investigate the distribution of medals across different countries and Olympic events over the years.

2. **Overall Analysis:** Explore number of olympic editions, cities, events, sports and athletes over the years.

3. **Country-wise Analysis:** Analyze individual country's performances in different Olympic editions, highlighting their medal achievements and sport preferences.

4. **Athlete-centric Analysis:**  Analyzes the age distribution of athletes, exploring potential connections between their height and weight relative to their medal accomplishments, and observing the patterns of participation among males and females across different Olympic editions.
